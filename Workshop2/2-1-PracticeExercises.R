# Practice Exercises for Workshop 2 Part 1
# Note, not all of these exercises require the use of R. It may be beneficial 
# for you to figure out how to do them in R, but it is not necessary


# A biased coin lands heads with probability 2/3. The coin is tossed 3 times. 
# Given that there was at least one head in the 3 tosses, what is the 
# probability that there were at least two heads? Use your answer to the 
# previous question to find the probability that there was exactly one head in 
# the three tosses given that there was at least one head in the three tosses.
# Now, what if the coin was actually biased with probability 0.68 to land heads, 
# how would your answer to the two questions change?


# Let X and Y be two independent indicator random variables, with P(X = 1) = p 
# and P(Y = 1) = r. Find E[(X + Y)^2] in terms of p and r. 

# Show that if E[Y|X] = b, where b is some constant, then Y is mean independent 
# of X; (X and Y are random variables)


# Give an example of two variables X, Y, where E[X|Y] = E[X] (i.e. they are mean
# independent) but X and Y are actually not independent

# Prove that the covariance of two mean independent random variables is equal to
# zero

# Show that for a sample of independent random variables X_1, ..., X_n that all 
# have the same distribution with mean a and variance b^2, Var(S) = b^2/n, where
# S is the average of all X_i (i.e. S = 1/n(X_1 + ... + X_n))

# Prove that Var(X - Y) = Var(x) + Var(Y) - 2Cov(X, Y)

# Prove Cov(a + bX, c + dY) = bdCov(X, Y)


# Observe how the sample mean of larger and larger samples come closer to the 
# mean of the chi square distribution with three degrees of freedom
# by computing the sample mean of random samples of 5, 10, 50, 100, 1000, 
# 10000, and 100000


# Observe how the sample mean of larger and larger samples of the exponential 
# distribution come closer to the expectation by computing the sample mean of
# random samples of 5, 10, 50, 100, 1000, 10000, and 100000


# Which sequence of sample means converged faster? That of the chi-squared 
# distribution or the exponential distribution

# Why might that be true?


# Take random samples of 100, 500, and 1000 from the t distribution with 5 
# degrees of freedom and from the normal distribution. Compute the difference 
# between the maximum values for each sample size. What does this show? Why does 
# this matter?
